This data-recording method makes it possible to identify various patterns of sleep, consisting of REM or Rapid eye movement stages — i.e. dreaming— and NREM or Non-rapid eye movement stages — i.e. sleeping. Charting each of these different states over a time axis results in a hypnogram, which can vary from sleep to sleep, and from human to human — However, many shared features or statistic expectations still arise from them. This inherent consistency might hence suggest one of many other possible questions to a composer: If sleeping and dreaming are natural phenomena with clear pattern behaviors, deep-rooted in our cognitive system, would using a hypnogram for musical mapping reveal something about the way we listen?.",

		"notes": "The ouroboros (from the Greek οὐρά, “tail” and βόρος, “devouring”) is an ancient symbol of cyclicality and infinity depicted by a serpent eating its own tail. This circular and self-devouring inclination is in essence the driving force behind «La Mirada del Ouroboros». The translation of such a symbol into sound is carried out through the idea of amputated repetitions, in which musical materials appear iteratively in increasingly incomplete presentations, thus giving a sense of imminent exhaustion.\n\nLikewise, the role of the soloist is linked to this image. The gradual changes of the harp pedal mechanism serve as harmonic catalysts to underscore the pitch content upon which the rest of the ensemble interacts. Such changes follow common-tone-based patterns, whose function is to eventually lead to the same point of departure, thus outlining a full harmonic cycle from beginning to end.\n\nThis circular behavior is simultaneously paired with an implementation of both symmetric proportions and golden ratio. These two elements are crucial during the musical development, as they often balance the pacing, shape, and organization in time of most musical events.\n\nThe immanent conflict between self-destruction and self-creation in the ouroboros also lends itself to the nature and character of the musical gestures. The images of sound structures falling apart and coming together, violent and delicate instrumental techniques, abrupt and organic transitions between sections, are all derived elements from this idea. At heart, this piece is an invitation to experience eye-to-eye the ouroboros inextricably unfolding in front of the listener.",

This tendency manifests itself both vertically — timbre and harmony — and horizontally — duration, rhythm, and time — with a particular emphasis on the perceptual domain.\n\nThe listener might then be able to notice instantiations of arborescence through the segmentation of the flute sound into multiple spectral strands, entangled rhythms that arise from juxtaposition of echoes, harmonies that stem and grow from the flute lines, or hierarchically established repetitions and fragmentations of sound sequences. Just like in trees, one might also occasionally hear semblances of chirps and warbles of the birds that inhabit them.",

As a means of highlighting this process, the live electronics undertake the role of either hampering or reinforcing the resonance of the open strings of the instrument, as well as its spectral components.\n\nThis piece is commissioned by, and written for viol player Brady Lanier, whose personal interests in pop music and culture are widely reflected in the music, interacting likewise with those of the composer.",

		"notes": "The title, «Los Trópicos Ocultos» (\"The Hidden Tropics\") is intended as a semantic representation of how the sound world of the piece behaves in time. The word “Tropic”, from Greek ‘tropikos' or Late Latin ‘tropicus', meaning a “turn” or \"change\", refers to the cyclical and rotating nature in which the musical ideas and elements co-exist. This term also alludes to those imaginary places — or tropics — that are created by an underlying musical idea which, although not easily recognizable, is always present.\n\nIn addition, this concept is partly achieved by the manipulation of the work's musical structure, wherein the linear musical discourse is distorted to influence the listener's perception of the time. The quote from Gaspar Noé’s film « Irreversible » (« Le temps détruit tout »), spoken by the performers during the course of the piece, is used as a poetic and dramatic means to underscore this premise.",

Likewise, it explores some of the different technical possibilities and capabilities of the harp, which at the same time become themselves a source of other musical materials.",
